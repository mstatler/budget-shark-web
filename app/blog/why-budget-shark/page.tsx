          Budget Shark is my attempt to take the budgeting/forecasting process I&apos;ve been doing at Marriott and
          make it simpler, repeatable, and way less spreadsheet-y. Most teams end up with scattered Excel files,
          emailed versions, weird column orders, and no single source of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I want is: upload → validate → promote → report. And I want department heads to be able to submit
          without breaking the template.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the site you&apos;re on right now (thebudgetshark.com) is the early marketing surface for that tool. While
          I&apos;m building out the ingest pipeline, I want to collect emails of people who want to try it as soon as
          I&apos;m ready.
